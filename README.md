# Astronomy Beyond Learning (ABL)

## Project Description
Astronomy Beyond Learning (ABL) is an interactive astronomy platform designed for anyone interested in exploring space through a modern and engaging experience. The platform combines scientific information about planets, social interaction through posts and comments, and a quiz-based learning game. ABL aims to make space exploration enjoyable, accessible, and enriched with meaningful community participation.

## Problem Statement
Most astronomy platforms present static information without real interaction or community involvement. People interested in space often cannot find a platform that blends scientific knowledge with social engagement and interactive learning.

## Solution
Astronomy Beyond Learning (ABL) creates an interactive and community-focused environment where users can explore planets, share posts, interact through comments, and improve their knowledge through a quiz-based game. The platform enhances the learning experience by encouraging participation and connecting users through their shared interest in space, supported by a structured role-based moderation system.
